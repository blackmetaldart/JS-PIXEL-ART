# PIXEL ART
> A CLIENT-SIDE APPLICATION THAT USES HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT TO MAKE IMAGES.

### GETTING STARTED
* Clone the project into a folder on your computer and open the HTML file in a web browser. 
* Type a generic color (i.e. red, blue, green) in the input box to set the color of the cursor brush.
* Move the cursor around the pixel-canvas on the bottom of the screen to begin creating images

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
* [HTML](https://html.com/) - The standard language for web browser documents
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - A stylesheet language for describing the presentation of HTML/[XML](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/) documents
* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - The cool text editor used to write the files

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
