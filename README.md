# PIXEL-ART
An application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow the user to make pixelated images.

## GETTING STARTED
* Clone the project into a folder on your computer and open the HTML file in a web browser. 
* Type a generic color (i.e. red, blue, green) in the input box to set the color of the cursor brush.
* Move the cursor around the pixel-canvas on the bottom of the screen to begin creating images

## BUILT USING
* [ATOM](https://atom.io) - The cool text editor used to write the files.
